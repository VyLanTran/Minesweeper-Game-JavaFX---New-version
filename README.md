## Project Information
Our team is creating a Minesweeper game with a variety of settings featured in a user-friendly GUI. 
Features will include different color themes, game board sizes, and difficulty levels. These will
be selectable by using a drop-down menu. A timer will begin when the player makes the first move, tracking
how long the player has been playing the game. The number of flags remaining will also be displayed.
Users will be able to quit or reset the game at any point that a game is in progress. Previous attempts will be
recorded, and players can try and beat their previous fastest time. Once the game is complete, the user will
see their final time and their fastest time, and can choose to play again.

## How to run it
To run our Minesweeper game, run MinesweeperMain.main(). Next, a medium-size board will appear
on the screen. The user should click any cell to start the game. The number in a cell represents the number
of neighboring bombs (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally). The goal is to flag any cells that contain
a bomb by right-clicking, and left click on any cells that do not contain bombs to show the cell contents.
If the user successfully clicks all the non-bomb-containing cells without clicking any with bombs, they win!
